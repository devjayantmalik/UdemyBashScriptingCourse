# First Script

Here is our first simple script. Go ahead and create `1st.sh` file with following contents:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello World"
```

1. In above script First line is Command Processor, which tells our terminal about the binary to use for script execution.
2. Second line is an `echo` command which outputs, whatever is passed to it. In this case it is `Hello World`
